# Model Hyperparameters Configuration
# FP-Growth Association Rule Mining

fp_growth:
  # Minimum support: fraction of transactions containing itemset
  # Lower values = more rules but slower training
  min_support: 0.01
  
  # Minimum confidence: P(consequent | antecedent)
  # Higher values = more reliable rules
  min_confidence: 0.3
  
  # Minimum lift: confidence / P(consequent)
  # Lift > 1 means positive correlation
  min_lift: 1.5

# Recommendation Scoring Parameters
scoring:
  # Number of top recommendations to generate per basket
  top_k: 10
  
  # Weight for popularity prior in scoring
  # 0.0 = pure rule-based, 1.0 = pure popularity
  popularity_weight: 0.2
  
  # Diversity penalty: penalize items from same aisle
  diversity_penalty: 0.1

# Evaluation Parameters
evaluation:
  # Hit-rate evaluation at different K values
  hit_rate_k_values: [5, 10, 20]
  
  # Minimum number of test baskets required
  min_test_baskets: 10000

# Data Processing Parameters
data:
  # Minimum basket size to include in training
  min_basket_size: 2
  
  # Maximum basket size (filter outliers)
  max_basket_size: 100
  
  # Minimum product frequency (filter rare products)
  min_product_frequency: 10
